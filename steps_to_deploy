# Steps to deploy
Environment Setup: Provision cloud resources like AWS S3, RDS Postgres, and set up necessary permissions.

Code Review and Testing: Conduct thorough reviews and run unit and integration tests for all modules.

Configuration Management: Externalize configurations using environment variables or configuration files. Handle sensitive data with tools like AWS Secrets Manager.

CI/CD Setup: Establish a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipeline for automated testing and deployment.

Containerization: Use Docker for consistent deployment and consider orchestration tools like Kubernetes for scalability.

Logging and Monitoring: Implement centralized logging with AWS CloudWatch or ELK stack. Set up alerts for anomalies.

Backup and Recovery: Regularly backup the RDS database and machine learning models, ensuring a recovery process is in place.

Final Testing & Go Live: Conduct final tests in the production environment, switch to "live" mode, and monitor closely during the initial phase.
