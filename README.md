# ETL Machine Learning Scaffold/BoilerPlate Code

A scalable mock-up for a machine learning prototype, built to integrate with big data architectures such as Kubeflow, AWS S3, and AWS RDS Postgres.

## Features:
- **Preprocessing Module:** Automates data preprocessing and storage.
- **Training Manager:** Orchestrates model training with data checks.
- **Inference Engine:** Manages model inference with latest trained models.
- **Postprocessor:** Prepares inferred results for downstream consumption.
- **State Manager:** Handles the stateful operations and database interactions.

## Setup:
1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure AWS CLI is set up with necessary permissions.
2. Clone this repository: `git clone [repository-link]`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Set up environment variables for AWS credentials and RDS configurations.
5. Execute the main pipeline script: `python main_pipeline.py`

## Design Principles:
- **Testability:** Every module is designed for unit and integration testing.
- **Modularity:** Each component serves a distinct function.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Different layers like data, logic, and presentation are distinct.
- **Extendibility:** The scaffold is built with future expansions in mind.
